## Repository URL
[GitHub Repo – alx-project-nexus](https://github.com/ochogwuprince92/alx-project-nexus)

## Project Objective
The goal of **Project Nexus (ProDev BE Capstone)** is to design and implement a **backend for a Job Board Platform**.  
This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, secure, and efficient backend systems that support real-world applications.

## Overview
This case study focuses on building a **Job Board Backend**.  
The backend facilitates job postings, **role-based access control**, and **efficient job search features**.  
It integrates advanced database optimization techniques and provides comprehensive API documentation for frontend integration.

## Project Goals
1. **API Development** – Build APIs for managing job postings, categories, and applications.  
2. **Access Control** – Implement role-based authentication and permissions for Admins and Users.  
3. **Database Efficiency** – Optimize job search with indexing and query optimization.  

## Technologies Used
| Technology   | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Django**   | High-level Python framework for rapid backend development |
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational database for storing job board data |
| **JWT**      | Secure, role-based authentication |
| **Swagger**  | API endpoint documentation |

## Key Features
- **Job Posting Management**  
  - APIs to create, update, delete, and retrieve job postings.  
  - Categorize jobs by **industry, location, and type**.  

- **Role-Based Authentication**  
  - **Admins** can manage jobs and categories.  
  - **Users/Job Seekers** can apply for jobs and manage applications.  

- **Optimized Job Search**  
  - Indexed queries for efficient filtering.  
  - Location-based and category-based filtering.  

- **API Documentation**  
  - Swagger docs hosted at:  
    ```
    /api/docs
    ```

## Implementation Process
- **Initial Setup**  
  - `feat: set up Django project with PostgreSQL`  
- **Feature Development**  
  - `feat: implement job posting and filtering APIs`  
  - `feat: add role-based authentication for admins and users`  
- **Optimization**  
  - `perf: optimize job search queries with indexing`  
- **Documentation**  
  - `feat: integrate Swagger for API documentation`  
  - `docs: update README with usage details`  

## Submission Details
- **Deployment**: API + Swagger documentation will be hosted and accessible online.  
- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - APIs handle job & category CRUD operations.  
  - Role-based authentication works correctly.  
  - Code is modular and follows Django best practices.  
  - Database schema is normalized and indexed.  
  - Job search is fast and efficient.  
  - Swagger documentation is detailed and hosted.  
  - README provides clear setup instructions.  

## Conclusion
The **Nexus Job Board Backend** demonstrates proficiency in backend engineering by combining:  
- Clean API design  
- Secure authentication  
- Optimized database queries  
- Clear documentation  

This project is a real-world applicable backend system that reflects industry standards.
